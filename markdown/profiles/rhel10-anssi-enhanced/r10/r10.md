# r10 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Disabling The Loading Of Kernel Modules

## Control Statement

The loading of the kernel modules can be blocked by the activation of the sysctl kernel.modules_disabled: Prohibition of loading modules (except those already loaded to this point) kernel.modules_disabled = 1

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# r10 - Disabling The Loading Of Kernel Modules

## Control Statement

The loading of the kernel modules can be blocked by the activation of the sysctl kernel.modules_disabled: Prohibition of loading modules (except those already loaded to this point) kernel.modules_disabled = 1

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The kernel configuration option to block the loading of kernel modules is presented
as seen in the /etc/sysctl.conf configuration file:
```
# Prohibits loading of kernel modules (except those already loaded at
# this point)
kernel.modules_disabled=1
```

Kernel modules can be listed to be loaded at boot time, before activating the option
kernel.modules_disabled. The list is declared in /etc/modules.
The list of currently loaded modules can be found with the command lsmod.

### Rules:

  - rule-r10

### Implementation Status: implemented
