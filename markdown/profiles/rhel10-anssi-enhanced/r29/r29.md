# r29 - \[REPLACE_ME\] Access Restrictions On /Boot

## Control Statement

When possible, it is recommended not to automatically mount the /boot partition. In any case, access to the /boot folder should only be allowed for the root user.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# r29 - Access Restrictions On /Boot

## Control Statement

When possible, it is recommended not to automatically mount the /boot partition. In any case, access to the /boot folder should only be allowed for the root user.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The Unix and derivative operating systems, and in particular GNU/Linux, have a separation of privileges which is based mainly on the notion of access accounts at two levels: the “regular” user accounts and the system administrator user account (commonly known as root).

This separation lacks granularity, in particular today where a user has fairly wide access to system
primitives (while being increasingly exposed to attacks: theft of accounts and identifiers, leaks of
information…), in-depth expert analysis is often required to highlight residual vulnerabilities in
order to minimize their consequences as much as possible.
