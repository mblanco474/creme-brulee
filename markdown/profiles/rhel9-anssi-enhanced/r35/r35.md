# r35 - Uniqueness And Exclusivity Of System Service Accounts

## Control Statement

Each service must have its own system account and be dedicated to it exclusively.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# r35 - Uniqueness And Exclusivity Of System Service Accounts

## Control Statement

Each service must have its own system account and be dedicated to it exclusively.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?
Access control consists of ensuring that an access account has sufficient rights to access to a given resource. Although access control allows for partitioning, the chosen approach is generally different from that adopted by virtualization mechanisms. Indeed, access control often leaves the reference to a system object visible to the application and returns an error if there is insufficient privilege to access it, while a system based on virtualization partitions the application by the absence of a reference to this object (pointer, path access…).

Access control under Unix and derivative systems has historically been based on the notion of user
and group of users. Other mechanisms have appeared, in particular through LSM of which SELinux
and AppArmor detail are the best known and most used, in order to allow an additional finer control of rights. But the separation of privileges based on user and user groups is still the most commonly used. It can be accompanied by partitioning mechanisms (UNIX compatible mechanisms, container…) or filtering (seccomp) in order to limit access to the underlying operating system.
