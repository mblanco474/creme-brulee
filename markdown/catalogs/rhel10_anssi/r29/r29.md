# r29 - Access Restrictions On /Boot

## Control Statement

When possible, it is recommended not to automatically mount the /boot partition. In any case, access to the /boot folder should only be allowed for the root user.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The Unix and derivative operating systems, and in particular GNU/Linux, have a separation of privileges which is based mainly on the notion of access accounts at two levels: the “regular” user accounts and the system administrator user account (commonly known as root).

This separation lacks granularity, in particular today where a user has fairly wide access to system
primitives (while being increasingly exposed to attacks: theft of accounts and identifiers, leaks of
information…), in-depth expert analysis is often required to highlight residual vulnerabilities in
order to minimize their consequences as much as possible.
