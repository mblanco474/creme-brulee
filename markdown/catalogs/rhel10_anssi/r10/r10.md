# r10 - Disabling The Loading Of Kernel Modules

## Control Statement

The loading of the kernel modules can be blocked by the activation of the sysctl kernel.modules_disabled: Prohibition of loading modules (except those already loaded to this point) kernel.modules_disabled = 1

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The kernel configuration option to block the loading of kernel modules is presented
as seen in the /etc/sysctl.conf configuration file:
```
# Prohibits loading of kernel modules (except those already loaded at
# this point)
kernel.modules_disabled=1
```

Kernel modules can be listed to be loaded at boot time, before activating the option
kernel.modules_disabled. The list is declared in /etc/modules.
The list of currently loaded modules can be found with the command lsmod.
