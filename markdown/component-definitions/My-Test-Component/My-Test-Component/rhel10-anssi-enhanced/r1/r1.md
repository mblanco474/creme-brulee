# r1 - Hardware Support

## Control Statement

Configure certain hardware options in order to harden the base that will be used for
the installation. This configuration should preferably be done before installation so
that the system is able to take this into account as soon as possible.

It is recommended to apply the configuration recommendations for Hardware support mentioned in ANSSI DAT-24.
